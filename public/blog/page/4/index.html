  <div class="entry-content"><p>Think of a wonderful world where you have every basic needs without much difficulty and effort. Quite interesting?? well, This is what <a href="http://www.sabayonlinux.org">sabayon</a> explains, where you will feel heaven if you are using slow Internet without compromising in quality and support. A bit confusing ?? we&#8217;ll see&#8230;</p>

<p>My journey with GNU/Linux started with gentoo 2 years before, when I had a tough time installing it as dual boot and of course, it ended up in the complete data loss !! My next linux-try was ubuntu 8.04, the one that Jesse had given, was easy to install and use. The next OS&#8217; that i tried was ubuntu 8.10, ubuntu 9.04, kubuntu 8.10 and fedora. But the problem with all these was they are CDs !! Though they contain all basic softwares and packages, it was a tough job to get additional ones. I had to rely on my slow Dial up connection which would take 15 minutes to download 10 MB!! So the one and only choice was to get a DVD based distro.</p>

<p>For the past few weeks, I was searching for such a DVD release distro so that the rate of software and package downloads can be minimised considerably. My next step was to find such a disrto. To download nearly 4.5 GB @ 16 kbps speed is obviously a nightmare. Then i thought of taking copy, but the source became a issue. As i don&#8217;t have any Linux based magazine&#8217;s subscription, it was almost impossible. But later i came to know that one my friends has such a subscription and he has a DVD that contains sabayon 4.</p>

<p>Then the things went pretty fast. The installation of sabayon was easy and without XFCE and games, it consumed nearly 9 GB and took 44 minutes to complete in my P4 2.6 GHz, 1.2 GB RAM Desktop. The intial boot soon after the installation was slow and it took around 2 minutes to get the login screen. Even now, it is a wonderful sight for me to see many desktop environments including KDE, GNOME etc.. in sessions menu :)</p>

<p>Sabayon 4 has all basic free software and package by default. sabayon is meant for all type of users. The software collection explains this. Inkscape, GIMP etc&#8230; are meant for graphic enthusiasts where GCC, JAVA,Python,etc.. are there for programmers. Like these, sabayom comes with many pretty and useful softwares so that users dont have to spend time searching for them. Well, there are the good sides of sabayon. As always, it has another side which is not serious but which worths mentioning here. In ubuntu and other distros, we can install any software or package by running &#8216;apt-get install&#8217; in terminal which is not possible in sabayon. Also, sabayon dont support deb/rpm packages by default though the team claims it is not necessory where the internal package manager is more than enough. But it would have been better if sabayon supports that also. Next issue is that, it doesn&#8217;t support malayalam by default where i had to install it manually.</p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;m not going more technical because, this is my limit. I should stop here, the rest ie about it&#8217;s core,kernel, working, etc&#8230; are available over web. Please have a look at it if you are interested. I haven&#8217;t read this post twice, so they are chances for grammatical/technical/spelling mistakes. Please point them out. Thank you</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello friends,</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad to present the Beta version of e-FLAMES for GNU/Linux before you. Thanks to<a href="http://thejpf-integratinglife.blogspot.com/"> Jesse</a>, for his valuable header file with getch() function in GNU/Linux. I have made minor changes in this version and now, it&#8217;s licensed under GPL V3. The program still has some errors when strings with special characters are given as input. Please help me correct those and make this program bug-free. I expect to release the final version before the end of this month. Till then, please try this program and give me your valuable comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello friends,</p>

<p>I&#8217;m back with a new C++ project &#8220;e-FLAMES&#8221;.  Please don&#8217;t expect more, i have just started with C++ (forgot to tell you, I&#8217;m studying in +1 CS). Here the &#8216;e&#8217; stands for electronic (copied from&#8220;&#8216;e-mail&#8221; ;) ) , and you know what the FLAMES game is !!</p>

<p>we should cut similar characters in one:one ratio and count the total number of rest characters and apply them on FLAMES. I did the program in this logic and its screenshot and source is like this :</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello friends,</p>

<p>For the past few days, i was searching for a good reason to write a blog. On my way, i met some nice friends and their blogs helped me a lot. You must know some facts before reading my articles, that is i&#8217;m niether good at english nor experienced at blogging but i can&#8217;t sit idle.</p>

<p>You might have wondered why i selected a name &#8221; syntax&#8221; for this blog (if not, please wonder), that is because i need a name related to computers but the words like &#8220;hack&#8221;,&#8221;hack log&#8221; etc. are already taken by my above mentioned friends x-(. But there also i don&#8217;t have a mind to give up, i chose &#8220;syntax&#8221;,which has no meaning in this context but it seems heavier than other words !! . So this is a start and i expect your co-operation and motivation. Thanks to all. Best wishes&#8230;</p>
